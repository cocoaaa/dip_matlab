This file contains information about Voronoi Laplace code which computes 
the new discrete Laplace matrix for point clouds based on the paper 
"Approximating Gradients for Meshes and Point Clouds via Diffusion Metric", 
Chuanjiang Luo, Issam Safa and Yusu Wang. SGP 2009. The code is written 
by Chuanjiang Luo.  

The source code as well as the binary code is distributed for Windows. 
The source code is ready to be compiled on other platform though it
is not tested.
